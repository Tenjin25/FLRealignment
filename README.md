# Florida Political Realignment Map: A Case Study

## Florida’s Political Realignment: Case Study Overview

### 1. Historical Battleground Status
Florida was the nation’s ultimate swing state from 2008–2016, with razor-thin margins and intense competition.

### 2. The DeSantis Factor (2018 and Beyond)
- **2018 Governor Election:** Ron DeSantis narrowly defeats Andrew Gillum, setting the stage for dramatic change.
- **COVID Response:** DeSantis emphasizes personal freedom, rapid reopening, and opposes extended lockdowns.
- **Policy Impact:** Conservative policies on education, public health, and business regulation attract national attention and migration.
- **2022 Landslide & Supermajority:** DeSantis wins re-election by a landslide; Republicans gain and maintain a legislative supermajority through 2024.

### 3. Population & Migration Shifts
- **Lockdown State Refugees:** Florida’s population surges as residents from states like California and New York move for more freedom and opportunity.
- **Migration Impact:** Influx of conservative-leaning migrants accelerates the shift.

### 4. Key Trends & Insights
- **Presidential Margin Surge:** Florida shifts from 1–2 point margins to a 13-point GOP win in 2024 (Trump: +3 in 2020, +13 in 2024).
- **Voter Registration:** Republicans overtake Democrats for the first time.
- **County-Level Shifts:** Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and other counties see dramatic margin changes and flips.
- **Hispanic/Latino Realignment:** Cuban, Venezuelan, and Puerto Rican communities move right.
- **National Implications:** Florida’s transformation changes presidential campaign strategies and party priorities.
